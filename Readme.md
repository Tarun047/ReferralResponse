# Why are you here ?
Most likely because you have asked me for a referral on LinkedIn or through mail or any other platform.

# Will I refer you ?
I prefer referring only the people whom I have profesionally worked with as part of my professional ethics. <br />
I believe that giving a referral means that  I am taking a stand that I believe that you'll be a strong fit for the role. <br />
And since I haven't worked with you before, I think that I can't perform a proper evaluation of your skills and how you react to various scenarios that you might face as part of your day job. <br />

# Why is this important ?
We should understand that going through an interview process is an expensive one, because once an interview is scheduled, the company has to invest resources either in form of time or money or often times both. <br />
Hence it's extremely vital that we don't waste our time and the company time and make sure that we treat the process of interviews with due respect.

# Do I believe that you will not be fit for the role you have asked me a referral for ?
Absolutely not, re-emphasising what I said, I simply am not the right person to judge your skills because I haven't had the chance to work with you yet! <br />
But by no means this is a discouragement, infact I'd suggest that you go ahead and apply for the role, if you think you can fit right in.

# Some tips when asking for a referral to anyone else.
While I did not refer you, it doesn't mean that others will not. <br />
The below statements might or might not apply to you depending on how you asked me for a referral, so take them with a grain of salt. <br />
It's generally a good practice to include links to the specific job ids that you want to get a referral for along with your updated resume and brief (max 3-4 lines) of why you think you fit for the role. <br />
This is of paramount importance because it shows that you are invested in your career and have done the right amount of research needed from your side to see if you fit for the job. <br />
Finally remember that **if you are not ready to invest in your career, you can't expect the person you are asking a referral to invest time for you** <br />

**All the best for your career**
